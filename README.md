### Q: What is this?
**A:** This repository contains a sizeable chunk of the research I conducted on **[QuantConnect](https://quantconnect.com)** and **[Quantopian](https://quantopian.com)** on both stocks and cryptocurrencies. I constructed these research journals in hopes of finding an edge I could use to trade on the markets (even as incomplete and inaccurate as they can be, they helped me vastly understand much more about the way these markets work). 
I'll eventually add in more of my research and trading algorithms as time progresses. Some of the research notebooks may be missing figures and other output cell blocks. Eventually, I'll get around to adding those.
